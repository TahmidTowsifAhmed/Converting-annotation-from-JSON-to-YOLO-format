# Converting-annotation-from-JSON-to-YOLO-format
## Project Description
As we are developing the roadscanner application that can detect damages, traffic signs and other necessary information on the roads, we came across several dataset. For Traffic Sign, the most sutiable dataset found for training was the [Mapillary Traffic Sign Dataset](https://www.mapillary.com/dataset/trafficsign). Howwver, the obstacle we encountered in the beginning is the annotation format of the labels. We are training machine on YOLOv7, which does not recognise the json annotation format. This repository contribute in conversion of these annotations (and also any similar type of annotations) to txt format to make it ready for training in YOLO and provide a step-by-step guideline for using the files.

## Dataset




**NEED TO REMEMBER HERE TO EXPLAIN THE CLASSES DETAILS**

**ALSO NEED TO ADD THE TXT FILE THAT EXPLAINS ALL THE ANNOTATION VALUES AND THEIR NUMBERS**
